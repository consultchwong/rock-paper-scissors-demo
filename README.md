# rock-paper-scissors-demo

This is a demo project for presenting advanced features of [boardgame.io](https://boardgame.io) including:

1. Turn Order = ANY
2. Secret State
3. Multiple Players

The game features classic game play of rock paper scissors which both players take action in same web page. 

The original demo of boardgame.io features game play in turn base. 

To simulate the real live game play of rock paper scissors, Turn Order = ANY is used so that both players can select actions (rock paper scissors) at any time without waiting another player finishing the move.

Also, the game uses "Secret State" to hide the action of another players before end game.
